		<p>The Texarkana Orthodox Christian Fellowship is a fellowship of both Orthodox Christian believers in the Texarkana metropolitan area as well as those who are simply interested in learning more about Orthodox Christianity.</p>
		<p>There are several Orthodox families in the Texarkana area, including families from Texarkana proper as well as from towns such as Lewisville and Magnolia, AR. The Lewisville family consists of three converts who drive an hour and a half every Sunday to St. Nicholas Orthodox Christian Church in Shreveport, LA, our mother parish.</p>
		<p>Services are held at the St. Patrick Chapel in Lewisville, AR approximately once a month. Services are also planned to be held at the Christ the King Chapel in Texarkana, TX, graciously provided by St. James Episcopalian Church under the care of Fr. Douglas.</p> 
		<p>We welcome you to learn more about<a href="orthodoxy.html">Orthodoxy</a>and to<a href="contact.html">contact us</a>if you have any questions at all. You are always welcome to join us at any regularly scheduled services.</p>
