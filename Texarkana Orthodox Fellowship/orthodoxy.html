	<p>Orthodoxy - what is it? In a word, it's what Christ taught, what the Apostles preached, and what's been handed down to Christian faithful without addition or subtraction throughtout the centuries. "Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever" - and if the Lord Himself is the same, then His Body, the Church, should be recognizable down through the centuries.</p>

	<p>This ancient form of Christianity has been practiced, virtually unchanged, for two thousand years; despite that, it remains virtually unknown in the West, despite being the predominate form of Christianity found in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Russia.</p>

	<p>In modern times, Orthodox Christianity has found its way to the United States through immigration from Orthodox countries and also through the conversion of Americans who have found in the Orthodox Church the fullness of the Christian revelation.</p>

	<p>Our Fellowship is part of the<a href="https://ww1.antiochian.org/">Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America</a>&mdash; the same Church of Antioch where Christians were first called Christians (Acts 11:26). While many of the faithful of the Archdiocese in North America are from traditionally Orthodox backgrounds, and increasing number are converts, including a great portion of those who form a part of this Fellowship. We firmly believe Orthodoxy is the birthright of all Christians, and indeed all people, regardless of ethnic or societal background, and in accord with that conviction we welcome all to explore, learn, and experience Holy Orthodoxy.</p>
